        <p class="container-elements">  Hi, I am Barış Giray Akman. I am 20. Currently, I am studying Computer Science at Marmara University.
            Sometimes, it bothers me but I am keeping it up. <br> At forthcoming years, I am planning to focus on web development and 
            machine learning. As much as I could, I am trying to enhance my skills related to those fields.
